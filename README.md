# crypto-view

crypto-view is a GUI to view crypto currency exchanges in real time with euros per minute that I developed together with [2namenlos0](https://github.com/2namenlos0).

It's a Python app that uses tkinter and ccxt.

The euros per minute are calculated using linear regression, which is also why there's an error value column. The higher the error value, the less precise is the gradient.

The text in the window is German but everything else is English.
